## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-Time Inventory Dashboard**: Monitor blood supply levels, quantities, and locations at a glance. Filter resources by blood type and status (Available, Low, Critical).
- **Urgent Request System**: Hospitals can broadcast urgent needs for specific blood types, defining quantity, urgency, and a notification radius (5km/10km).
- **Active Alerts**: Donors and blood banks can view a live feed of active urgent requests and respond to them.
- **AI-Powered Supply Forecasting**: Utilizes Genkit and Google's Gemini AI to predict future blood demand based on historical data and upcoming events, helping to proactively manage inventory.
- **AI-Powered Urgent Request Analysis**: An AI agent analyzes the parameters of an urgent request (blood type, quantity, urgency, donor count) to recommend the optimal alert timing and scope.
- **Donor Management**: View and manage a list of registered donors, with filtering by blood type and location.
- **Analytics**: Visualize blood supply data through interactive charts, showing inventory by blood type and status.
- **Splash Screen**: An animated splash screen that provides a polished and engaging entry into the application.
